Welcome to ADAR (Advanced Digital Asset Routing) - a unique solution for businesses to seamlessly transmit digital assets to payees around the world, in multiple currencies, at a fraction of today‚Äôs prevailing transaction costs, without excessive paperwork and settlement times. In this guide, we will go through all the main ADAR user cases, describing each stage in detail.

> üìù In this guide, we will use a test environment - all links inserted further will point exactly to the test components.

**Step 1.** Proceed to a https://testnet.adar.com

As you know, ADAR  is based on the SORA blockchain. To read more about SORA blockchain, please proceed to https://sora.org. This means that you need to use wallets compatible with the network to explore ADAR.

The demo example will use the `polkadot.js` extension. To install the extension and read the documentation, please visit https://polkadot.js.org/extension/.

Once the wallet is successfully connected, you will see a corresponding address on the top right corner.

*Step 3.2.* Enter the address of your wallet and the amount to be topped up

*Step 3.3.* Execute the faucet

*Step 3.4.* Check your wallet balance on https://testnet.adar.com/#/wallet to see, whether faucet transaction successfully worked

Step 3.2.1. If there are issues with the configuration, ADAR will indicate them in the consice form so that you can edit a `csv` file and consequently re-upload it

*Step 3.3.* Select an input asset

![](./assets/input_asset_selection.png)

As part of the current version, ADAR can use only one source asset and any number of target assets for batch transfer of funds. This means that if the user specified `PSWAP` to receive, and `XOR` was selected as the source asset, then `XOR` will first be automatically converted to `PSWAP` and then sent.

*Step 3.4.* Confirm the transaction

*Step 3.5.* Sign the transactions

![](./assets/sign.png)

In case when before transfering the assets a conversion will have to be done, within the current implementation you will need to sign several transactions. In any case, it will always be done within a web extension.

*Step 3.6.* Wait until the transaction is included in the blockchain. Once the transactions are executed successfully, ADAR will display the corresponding statuses on a web page

Step 3.6.1. If there were problems with batch transfers, you will see the corresponding errors and you can immediately try to make the transfer again within the UI

*Step 3.7.* Download an automatically generated PDF file
